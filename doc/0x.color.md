# Colorlib

Ever wanted to create a neat little gradient in KFX? Been frustrated by colorspaces, since RGB gradients rarely really turn out the way you want? Look no further!

Colorlib gives you a multitude of useful[^1] functions for manipulating colors in ASS (and, hey, why not outside it too).

## Interpolation

Linear interpolation between two colors in a given colorspace. Arguments for all are in the same format:

```interp_xxx(t, color_1, color_2)```

- `t`: "Distance" to go, from 0 to 1, inclusive. A value of 0 corresponds to `color_1`, a value of 1 to `color_2`. A value of 0.5 is halfway.
- `color_1`: "Starting" color
- `color_2`: "Ending" color

Currently, these four colorspaces are supported:

- `interp_lch` - LCh (CIE L\*C\*h)
- `interp_lab` - CIELAB (L\*a\*b\*)
- `interp_rgb` - simple RGB
- `interp_xyz` - XYZ (CIE 1931 XYZ)

In addition, `interp_alpha` is a function with an equivalent signature for ASS alpha values.
